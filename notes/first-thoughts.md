In terms of processing a "web" of associated objects - in this project, people - a hefy amount of looping is required, such that drafting out every possible path may be calculated, allowing then for individual paths to be guessed.

One approach might well be to work out simultaneously from both the start node and the end node, how to link these two node(again, people). While a literal midpoint isn't neccesarily given, it works well to try and work out how to draw these two nodes 'closer' by finding node which are likely to be connected to a lot of people, and therefore more likely to be connected to another person necceasary in the path.

It would also help if, when narrowing down a particular path search between nodes, nodes deemed entirely useless through lack of connection(i.e. limited/no friends/followers), could be removed entirely from any kind of loops and qureries, hence making searches far easier.

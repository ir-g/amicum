	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<h2>By Deep Sohelia, 3rd October 2015</h2>
	<p>
		This is our first post! We have just finished writing the code for the blog! <br />
		This Blog will be updated monthly if not weekly, with updates on the progress of Amicum, along with how you can participate. We will feature both our thoughts and actual implementation of the algorithm, along with what we will use it for. In other words, watch this space. <br /> <br />
		
		<span class="h3">How this blog works</span><br/>
		This was entirely created by me, <a href="//chillibyte.github.io">Deep Sohelia</a> both the template and the post loading system. The only exception being the use of AHAH, or Asyncronous HTML and HTTP, a small (8 lines or so) script which is used to fetch these posts. There is no jQuery involved, thankfully. The system works by storing the file names of all posts that are to be loaded in an array, and then looping through the array, loading in each post. While not the most elegant of solutions, it is the lightest in terms of SLOC. It means I can use as <strong>much fancy markup</strong> as I want, making it my far the most lightweight and customizable way for me to make blog posts. <br /> 
		The template is downloadable over <a href="//chillibyte.github.io/templates/">here</a>.

		All of the artwork and photography for this blog is from <a href="//unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>, who offer free to use high resolution images. We at Amicum love their artwork and highly recommend it to any developer.

	<h1>How the Amicum algorithm works</h1>

		We have been thinking on how to actually find a path, let alone the shortest path in a network, and we have an Idea as to how to do this.<br />
		<br/>
		<span class="h3">The nature of networks</span><br/>
		Networks in the real world, be they of computer systems, the spread of disease or, in this case, the interconnectedness of mankind differ wildly, and no two networks will be the same. There are many factors one must take into consideration when analyzing a network. These include: <br />
		&#09;- Size<br/>
		&#09;- Clustering<br/>
		&#09;- Spread/Interconnectedness<br/>
		&#09;- Complexity<br/>
		<br />
		These factors are all key when pathfinding through a network - larger networks, more clustered networks, isolated networks and complex networks are all much harder and more time consuming to route through compared to small, interconnected, simple networks. <br/>
		Due to these wildly varying variables, we decided it was necessary that there was a single algorithm for all networks rather than attempting to judge the state of the network in an attempt to "streamline" the pathfinding procedure. This sacrifices speed, but it means that the SLOC written are drastically reduced.<br/>
		<br />
		<span class="h3">How the algorithm works</span><br/>
		Assume we have a network not visually unlike <a href="http://hansolav.net/sql/dijkstra_graph.png" target="_blank">This one</a>, and we only know the origin and target node.<br/>
		<br/>
		Each node contains two key values, along with any extra necessary data showing what it represents. These values are the distance from the orgin and the distance from the end. Both of these values are set to "", <samp>null</samp>  or <samp>undefined</samp>.<br/>
		For example, if these nodes were people, they'd be stored as something like this:<br/>
		<code>
		{<br />
			"name":"John Doe",<br />
			"age":20,<br />
			"friends":["Foo Bar","John Smith"],<br />
			"distStart":null,<br />
			"distEnd":null<br />
		}<br />
		</code><br/>
		The algorithm begins by assigning the origin node a <samp>distStart</samp> of 0, and the target node a <samp>distEnd</samp> of -0 (Yes thats a number.). The reason as to why a negative value is used will become apparent as the algorithm terminates. <br/>
		The program then loops through the partner nodes of the origin node, assigning them all a <samp>distStart</samp> of 1 and checking each one if they have a <samp>distEnd</samp> assigned. If there is a <samp>distEnd</samp> assigned at this stage, it must be -0 and so we have found the shortest path, as the two nodes are linked by only one path.<br />
		<br />
		Assuming that the network is more complex than that, the loop terminates and we now have a network with 0, 1, and -0 nodes assigned. We then loop through the partner nodes of the target node, and assign each of them a <samp>distEnd</samp> of -1. If any of them have a <samp>distStart</samp> assigned, then we know that we have a link and we can trace backward from this point to the orign and start node to get a direct path that is guaranteed to be the shortest.<br/>
		<br />
		But what if there are multiple points with both defined?<br/>
		Well, assuming the algorithm is implemented correctly, both of the points are equally valid and both will give the shortest path from the origin to the target.<br/>
		If the origin and target nodes are further apart than this, then this positive/negative looping cycling continues until a point is found with a <samp>distStart</samp> and <samp>distEnd</samp> is defined, after which the path can be traced forward and back.<br/>
		<br /> <br/>
		<span class="h3">Worked Example</span><br/>
		Assume we have <a href="http://hansolav.net/sql/dijkstra_graph.png" target="_blank">this network</a>, and we wish to find the shortest route from. Seattle to Washington DC, assumng the distance between each and every city is exactly the same.<br />
		<br />
		We first give the Seattle Node a <samp>distStart</samp> of 0 and DC a <samp>distEnd</samp> of -0. Then, we give San Francisco, Minneapolis and Denver a <samp>distStart</samp> of 1. None of these cities has a <samp>distEnd</samp> assigned, so the loop continues.
		We then give Boston, New York, Miami, Dallas and Chicago a <samp>distEnd</samp> of -1. Again, none of these cities have a <samp>distStart</samp> defined, so the loop continues. We now loop through the nodes with a <samp>distStart</samp> of 1 and give their partner nodes a <samp>distStart</samp> of 2 if they do not already have one.
		This means that Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Los Angeles all have a <samp>distStart</samp> of 2 assigned. The other <samp>distStart</samp> values were not changed as that would not be the most in efficient route. (Why go from Seattle to Denver via Minneapolis if you can go directly?)<br />
		<br />
		We now have 2 nodes with a <samp>distStart</samp> and <samp>distEnd</samp> defined - The Chicago and Dallas nodes. As the amicum algorithm is not designed nor intended to deal with real-world distances, both of these nodes are considered to be equally distant, and therefore either can be chosen. We then store one of these central nodes in an Array. <br />
		<br />
		In this case, lets pick Chicago. We have our midpoint of chicago and we can work forward an back from here. We then push the node connected to the chicago node with a <samp>distStart</samp> of 2 to the array - in this case, Minneapolis. If we had chosen Dallas instead of Chicago then we could have used Denver instead of Minneapolis.<br />
		<br />
		Our array now looks like this: <samp>["Chicago","Minneapolis"]</samp><br />
		<br />
		We then push the partner node of the Minneapolis node with a <samp>distStart</samp> of 0 - i.e the target node. <br />
		Our array now looks like this: <samp>["Chicago","Minneapolis","Seattle"]</samp> <br />
		<br />
		We now loop forward from the central node - that is, we look forward from Chicago. Chicago has a <samp>distEnd</samp> of -1 so we find the node with <samp>distEnd</samp> of -1 + 1 = -0, or, in other words, we push the target node to the array.<br />
		Our array now looks like this: <samp>["Chicago","Minneapolis","Seattle","Washington DC"]</samp><br/>
		<br />
		We now need to sort this array to show the order traversed. We do this by using the <samp>distStart</samp> and <samp>distEnd</samp> values.<br />
		Our array now looks like this: <samp>[2,1,0,-0]</samp>. <br />We use 2 instead of -1 as 2 was the last number assigned, though it does not really matter at this point, it just makes the next step easier. <br/>
		The negative values are already in order as we looped forwards, but the positive values are in reverse order. To do this, we remove the negative values and put them into another array, preserving the order, an then we sort the positive numbers by size, before returning the negative numbers unaltered.<br />
		Our array now looks like this: <samp>[0,1,2,-0]</samp>		<br />
		<br />
		Now we simply convert the numbers back to their original names.<br />
		Our array now looks like this: <samp>["Seattle","Minneapolis","Chicago","Washington DC"]</samp><br/>
		<br />
		And, Hey presto! We now have the shortest route in an array, ready to be used for whatever you need!<br/>
		Watch this space as we implement this algorithm in Javascrit and put it to good use.
